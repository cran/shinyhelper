#' shinyhelper.
#'
#' Easily add markdown helpfiles to your shiny apps, by adding a single function
#' around a shiny input or output. This adds a small 'question mark' help button,
#' which presents a markdown file in a modalDialog when clicked.
#' 
#' There is also a convenient helper function to initialise a directory of markdown
#' files given a vector of input and output IDs.
