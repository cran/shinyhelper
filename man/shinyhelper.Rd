\description{
Easily add markdown helpfiles to your shiny apps, by adding a single function
around a shiny input or output. This adds a small 'question mark' help button,
which presents a markdown file in a modalDialog when clicked.
}
\details{
There is also a convenient helper function to initialise a directory of markdown
files given a vector of input and output IDs.
